  <h2>Core Layout Classes</h2>
</header>

<p>
  There are three core layout definers in Latticeworks:
  boxes, groups, and cells.
</p>

<section id="cells">
  <h3>Cells</h3>
  <p>A cell class provides a percentage-based width to an element, determined by the class.</p>
  <p>
    Cells line up next to each other up until they exceed the width of the containing element,
    at which point the next cell will wrap around to the following line.
  </p>
  <p>
    The class name format is <code>.lw-cell-<em>$n</em>-<em>$i</em></code>,
    and that class would have a width property of <code><em>$i</em>/<em>$n</em> * 100%</code>.
    Here's an example.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    <span class="lw-cell-12-12">12</span>
    <span class="lw-cell-12-1">1</span>
    <span class="lw-cell-12-2">2</span>
    <span class="lw-cell-12-3">3</span>
    <span class="lw-cell-12-3">3</span>
    <span class="lw-cell-12-2">2</span>
    <span class="lw-cell-12-1">1</span>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <span class="lw-cell-12-11">11</span>
    <span class="lw-cell-12-2">2</span>
    <span class="lw-cell-12-10">10</span>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="groups">
  <h3>Groups</h3>

  <p>A group class is by default 100% of the width of its parent element.</p>
  <p>
    It is intended to be used to separate groups (hence the name) of elements
    from other elements in the flow of the page.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    <span class="lw-cell-12-6">Before Groups</span>
    <div class="lw-group">
      <span class="lw-cell-12-6">First Group</span>
      <span class="lw-cell-12-6">First Group</span>
      <span class="lw-cell-12-3">First Group</span>
    </div>
    <div class="lw-group">
      <span class="lw-cell-12-9">Second Group</span>
      <span class="lw-cell-12-3">Second Group</span>
      <span class="lw-cell-12-6">Second Group</span>
    </div>
    <span class="lw-cell-12-6">After Groups</span>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="boxes">
  <h3>Boxes</h3>
</section>
