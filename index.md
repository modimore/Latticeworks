### Latticeworks ###

A grid styling framework written in Sass, intended for customized use through mixins.

Latticeworks promotes an opt-in model for its features,
and is designed so you can easily use your own naming conventions with it's styling.

Latticeworks is primarily a layout system,
so to the highest extent possible cosmetic decisions are left up to the end-user.

or [Usage][] if you might want to use Latticeworks in your own projects.
